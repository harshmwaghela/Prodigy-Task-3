# Prodigy-Task-3
Create a decision tree classifier that uses behavioral and demographic data to forecast a customer's likelihood of purchasing a good or service. I utilized the UCI Machine Learning Repository's bank marketing dataset for this task.

# Data Preparation: 
To eliminate missing values, encode category variables, and scale numerical features, the dataset underwent preprocessing.
# Model Development: 
Using Python modules, a decision tree classifier was developed, offering sufficient training and validation.
# Evaluation of the Model: 
F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall were used for evaluating the model's performance.

Utilized tools were Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Python (Jupyter Notebook).

I had a fantastic opportunity to learn more about machine learning methods, namely decision trees, through this project. It underlined how important feature engineering and data preparation are to creating trustworthy prediction models. Moreover, the knowledge gained from model assessment has been very helpful in comprehending the advantages and disadvantages of the classifier. 

# Task-03

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
